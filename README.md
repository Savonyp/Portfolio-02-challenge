# Portfolio-02-challengee
POV: A potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

hollie and jusstus looked over my index
helped zae start his
 
 I understand my index and css is very very messy but im trying as hard as i can with the time frame and i can only get better from here. i typed my about me from my resume yet i am a very fast learner if showed and walked thru correctly. i dont really have any projects to show nor could i figure out how to do css properly while looking thru millions of youtube videos and w3schools. i tried making all my sections connect to the buttons with the help of a classmate named jusstus showing me with adding a "section id" however when u click on them... idk thats why they all look like links but at least they work. its just not pretty bc my css needs work.
